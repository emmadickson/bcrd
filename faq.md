<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif;" class="black-text" > How do I get in touch with y'all?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363" > Shoot us an email at bullcityrollerderby@gmail.com or like our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/828934163853486/">facebook group.</a> </p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif;" class="black-text" > So is there, like, a ball?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363">There is no ball.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif; " class="black-text" > What if I don't know how to skate?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363"> That's okay! A lot of our current skaters only started skating this year. We hold twice-yearly
Booty Camps where you can come, try out skating for the first time, and learn some of the
basic skills that you need to join our league as a Skater Tot. Our skaters also love to go to
Wheels Fun Park on Wednesdays for their Cheap Skate night (only $3!). It’s a great place
to meet people in the league and get more confident on your skates. Follow us on
Facebook to learn when our next Booty Camp will be held.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif; " class="black-text" > What do I need to get started?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363"> If you're skating at one of our practices, you must also wearing knee pads, wrist guards, elbow pads, a mouth guard and a helmet in addition to your skates.
Roller derby is a full contact sport and, although we try to play safe, injuries can and will happen.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif; " class="black-text" >Do I need my own equipment to join?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363"> Buying skate gear can be a daunting and expensive venture, so it is completely understandable if you do not want to immediately launch into it.
While you’ll probably want to get your own gear if you plan to keep skating with us, Wheels has skates available for Skater Tots who are still getting a feel for the sport and BCRD has sets of pads and helmets
available for loan. We’re also happy to talk to you about the best places to get gear locally
and how to put together a full set of equipment on the cheap.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif; " class="black-text" >Y’all are so cool but full-contact roller skating just isn’t for me. How else can I help?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363">You’re our favorite person! A roller derby league is so much more than just its skaters:
any form of help is welcome. We need Refs, NSOs (None Skating Officials),
announcers, and just general volunteers to helping with fundraising and out reach. If you
used to play derby but feel like your bouting days are done, ask us about getting involved
with training and coaching. Any little bit helps. If you're feeling especially generous, donate
to our paypal at bullcityrollerderby@gmail.com.</p>

<h5 style="font-family: 'Passion One', sans-serif; " class="black-text" >Did you see that one movie "Whip It"?</h5>
<p style="color:#636363"> Yeah, it was pretty cool. We're way cooler.</p>
