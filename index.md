founded in 2015 by a couple of skaters who thought that a community as vibrant as Durham deserved its own roller derby league. Since then, we’ve grown from five skaters doing laps
in the back of the Ponysaurus warehouse to a group of over thirty skaters who practice,
scrimmage, and bout together – and we’re growing all the time!

<p style="color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height: 150%;  text-align: left;">
We're the first Durham-based roller derby league and we want you! We're open to all women-identified, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming folx
  who want to skate fast, hit hard and get down and derby. Email bullcityrollerderby@gmail.com for more info.</p>
