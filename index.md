<p style="color:gray; font-size:16px; line-height: 150%;  text-align: left; ">We're here! A lot of us are queer, and we want you to join us. BCRD was
founded in 2015 by a couple of skaters who thought that a community as vibrant as Durham deserved its own roller derby league. Since then, we’ve grown from five skaters doing laps
in the back of the Ponysaurus warehouse to a group of over thirty skaters who practice,
scrimmage, and bout together – and we’re growing all the time!

<h6>Athletic Integrity:</h6>
<p> We play safely and fairly. We treat competitors, referees, volunteers, and teammates with respect.</p>
