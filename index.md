<h6 style="color:#636363; font-size:16px;">We're here! A lot of us are queer, and we want you to join us. BCRD was
founded in 2015 by a couple of skaters who thought that a community as vibrant as Durham deserved its own roller derby league. Since then, we’ve grown from five skaters doing laps
in the back of the Ponysaurus warehouse to a group of over thirty skaters who practice,
scrimmage, and bout together – and we’re growing all the time!
