<p style="color:#636363" class="flow-text">These are some of the lovely humans who skate with us! Our skaters come from all over the Triangle.
You might see us on campus, around RTP, or at the farmerâ€™s market. We spend our days working at non-profits, in labs, or at coffee
shops. Some of us have families, others prefer our fur babies. Some of us have tattoos. A
lot of us are queer-identified. But we all have one thing in common: we love roller derby.</p>
